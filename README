Versionr is used to bump the version number of your files. 

This gem was created to use in conjunction with another project that will build gemspec files - But wanted to isolate the functionality.

Start an instance of versionr by passing it the directory your VERSION file resides in. The default is Dir.pwd .

v = Versionr.new
v = Versionr.new('../info')
v.bump_major
v.bump_minor
v.bump_patch
